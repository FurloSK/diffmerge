README.txt for SourceGear DiffMerge.

This directory "$(ProgramFiles)\SourceGear\DiffMerge" is installed by 
the stand-alone DiffMerge MSI installer.

With the 3.3.1 release this directory is now just a placeholder.  All
of the DiffMerge components are now distributed in a shared MSM and
simply referenced by the stand-alone DiffMerge installer and by the
Vault and Veracity products.

These shared resources are installed in "$(ProgramFiles)\SourceGear\Common\DiffMerge".
